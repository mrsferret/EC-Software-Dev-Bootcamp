Mystery challenge set up for mock interview with company 2i. 

It is a simple game which asks the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. The user inputs their guess via a simple html form where it is validated to ensure the input number is present,numeric, and is between the range of 1 and 10 (inclusive)
Once the user has submitted their guess, it is compared to the random number and an appropriate message is output to the screen depending on whether the guess is more than, less than or equal to the random number.
The user can repeat their guesses until it matches the random number.

SUggested improvements: 
- Amend code to only allow the user a certain number of guesses before either the user guesses correctly or the the game finishes displaying an appropriate message that the user has failed to correctly guess the random number
- add a button to enable the user to exit out of the game
